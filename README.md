# KTP Capstone

Building a social graph for KTP Members. Created by Romir Mohan.

## Description

Each KTP member is a node on the graph. Backend is run by parsing through firebase data to get specific member connections. Then, a model is run to identify connections between members and generate a "score" struct that highlights strength of the connection and similarities. Frontend is an interactable graph where you can select member nodes and also connections to see the similarities.
